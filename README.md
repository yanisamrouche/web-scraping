# web-scraping
to practice my web-scraping skills i created a simple website that lists the top 50 instagram influencers by the number of quality and engaged followers by scraping instagram data, so the process is just a loop of scraping inserting and serving back to the front-end. <br/>
# Technologies used
- in the front-end : HTML, CSS & Javascript.
- in the back-end : NodeJS and for the scraping tool i used 'puppeteer' which is a NodeJS library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
- for the database (local) : MySql <br/>
# Commands
-npm i express typeorm mysql puppeteer
-run the server first with : node server.js
